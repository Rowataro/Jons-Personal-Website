<h2>2017-2019</h2>
<h3>FIRST Robotics Deep Space Competition (2019)</h3>
<p>I joined my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> FRC </a>  high school robotics team in 2017, and I became the lead programmer in 2019, 
which was memorable to me because with the help of the junior programmers we were able to brainstorm new control innovations. We were able to  make our robot accelerate smoother, which reduced the wear on the drive train and allowed for more precise driver control.</p>

<p>Here was how the robot was moving before:</p>

<p>Here was how the robot was moving after:</p>

<p>Also, our robot also had a metal arm with a hook that would move up and down to place a disk (placing disks was one way of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mew6G_og-PI" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">
scoring points </a>):<br /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the 3D printed spool in the video broke <em>right before competition!</em>. I MacGyvered a more durable spool we could use when competition came around: I took two <a href ="https://www.andymark.com/products/500ex-hex-hub" style ="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> wheel hubs </a> 
and stuck them together with some <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JynysLv9R4" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">JB weld </a> (metal epoxy):
<p> Here was me testing it at home: </p>

<p> We did have to shave it down to fit our robot, but it worked! </p>
<p> Unfortunately, I couldn't find a picture of the entire team (Team 988: Steel Phoenix üê¶‚Äçüî•), but I did find a picture in one of our outreach events:</p>

<h2>2019-2023</h2>
<p>The following are the projects I worked on while I was a student studying Computer Engineering (CpE) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (<a href = "https://www.unlv.edu/ece" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">UNLV)</a></p>
<h3>Departure Mood: An Emotionally Intelligent Airport Kiosk</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eoM-_BEpfh4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This was a project I did with architecture majors for <a href = "https://proxiima.com/las-vegas-makeathon-2" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> Las Vegas Make-A-Thon 2.0 </a> hosted by UNLV. 
I thought it was a cool idea, but the prototype itself was pretty simple (just an Arduino, a shield, some buttons, and LEDs) because I only had one day to do it and this was my first time working with an Arduino.
We made it to team finals (I think because our presentation was really good)!</p>

<h3>CS:VO: A 2D Shooter</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v08HAqPxEKY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A single-player 2D version of CS:GO, where the player, map, and weapon projectiles were all ASCII characters. In the video, the '@' is the player moving and the 'A' is the bot moving. I thought it was cool.</p>

<h3>Tremors: A Shooter Arcade Game on FPGA</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypymxCGWwvQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A game I made for my first submission to <a href = "https://eelabs.faculty.unlv.edu/index.html?navi=junior_design" style = "color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> UNLV's Junior Design competition</a>. 
With the help of my partner, we made a shooter arcade game made in Verilog and deployed on the DE2-115 FPGA. We had to design the hardware to do everything (no operating system or libraries to rely on!).</p>

<h3>Disco 9: A Memory Matching Game on FPGA</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqTe_SQA-rU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A game I made for my second submission to UNLV's Junior Design competition that won third place. 
I had to design the hardware to do everything (no operating system or libraries to rely on!).</p>

<h3>SMP8: An 8-bit microprocessor</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmW5DqQsdjg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This is an 8-bit microprocessor that I designed in Verilog and deployed to a DE2-115 FPGA. I know it's not as visually appealing as the games, but I thought it was really cool making a CPU (albeit a very very primitive one.)</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cNmFJGYol2hDwvUg7Z4IkGo-v1-dCHTZq7IDEi2Qpjk/edit?usp=sharing">the diagram of the microprocessor and the instructions it could do.</a></p>

<h3>Embedded Systems: A Cool Radar</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTDmbBlDd_Y" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> This is a radar that I made with an ultrasonic distance sensor, a servo motor, and an Atmega328PB microcontroller. 
It was one of the more visual things from my embedded systems class. That class was one of my favorites!</p>

<h3>Capstone Project: UFC Smart Grappling dummy</h3>
<p> This is my capstone project still under construction üî®... </p>

<h3>Jon's Adventures in Tech Website</h3>
<p> You're on it right now! This is a way for me to learn web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and share my creations.</p>
