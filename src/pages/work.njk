<h2>2017-2019</h2>
<h3>FIRST Robotics Competition</h3>
<p>I joined my FRC high school robotics team in 2017 (Team 988 üê¶‚Äçüî•), and I was the lead programmer in 2019.</p>
<p>With the help of the junior programmers, we were able to fine tune the controls to make our robot accelerate smoother, which reduced the wear on the drive train and allowed for more precise driver control.</p>

<p>Here was how the robot was moving before:</p>

<p>Here was how the robot was moving after:</p>

<p>Our robot also had a metal arm with a hook that would move up and down to place a disk (placing disks was one way of scoring point).:<br /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the 3D printed spool in the video broke (<em>right before competition!</em>), so I MacGyvered a more durable spool we could use when competition came around -- I took two wheel hubs and stuck them together with some JB weld (metal epoxy):
<p>And to my suprise it worked (though we had to shave it down a little bit when we installed it)!</p> 
<p>Here was me testing it at home:</p>

<h2>2019-2023</h2>

<p>And these were the projects I worked on while I was a student studying Computer Engineering (CpE) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV)</p>
<h3>Make-A-Thon: Departure Mood (An Emotionally Intelligent Airport Kiosk)</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eoM-_BEpfh4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This was a project I did with architecture majors for UNLV's Las Vegas Make-A-Thon 2.0. I thought it was a cool idea, but the prototype itself was pretty simple because I only had one day to make it. Regardless, we made it to the team finals!</p>

<h3>CS:VO: A 2D Shooter</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v08HAqPxEKY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A single-player 2D version of CS:GO, where the player, map, and weapon projectiles were all ASCII characters. In the video, the '@' is the player moving and the 'A' is the bot moving.&nbsp;A.</p>

<h3>Tremors: A Shooter Arcade Game on FPGA</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypymxCGWwvQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A game I made for my first submission to UNLV's Junior Design competition. With the help of my partner, we made a shooter arcade game made in Verilog and deployed on the DE2-115 FPGA.</p>

<h3>Disco 9: A Memory Matching Game on FPGA</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqTe_SQA-rU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A game I made for my second submission to UNLV's Junior Design competition that won third place. I know it's not that impressive, but I had to design it in Verilog and not use anything like Javascript.</p>

<h3>SMP8: An 8-bit microprocessor</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmW5DqQsdjg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This is an 8-bit microprocessor that I designed in Verilog and deployed to a DE2-115 FPGA. I know it's not as visually appealing as the games, but I thought it was really cool making a CPU, albeit a very very primitive one.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cNmFJGYol2hDwvUg7Z4IkGo-v1-dCHTZq7IDEi2Qpjk/edit?usp=sharing">the diagram of the microprocessor and the instructions it could do.</a></p>

<h3>Embedded Systems Radar</h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTDmbBlDd_Y" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> This is a radar that I made with an ultrasonic distance sensor, a servo motor, and an Atmega328PB microcontroller. I thought it looked cool.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>UFC Grappling dummy</h3>
<p> This is my capstone project still under construction...</p>

<h3>Jon's Adventures in Tech</h3>
<p>I wanted to make a website to learn more about web development, and you're on it!</p>
